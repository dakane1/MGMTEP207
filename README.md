Please do the following prior to the in class activity on 1/18/19.  
    1. Download Anaconda onto your laptop.  There are instructions below for Windows, macOS, and Linux. 
    2. Download the data into a folder on your desktop.
    3. Download the Python notebook into the same folder as your data.

**1. Download Python**

Python is a popular language for research computing, and great for general-purpose programming as well. Installing all of its research packages individually can be a bit difficult, so we recommend Anaconda, an all-in-one installer.

Regardless of how you choose to install it, please make sure you install Python version 3.x (e.g., 3.6 is fine).

We will teach Python using the Jupyter notebook, a programming environment that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers are all supported (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9 and below, are not).

Windows Video Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQ0mzZ8UvA

1. Open https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows with your web browser.
2. Download the Python 3 installer for Windows.
3. Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation except make sure to check Make Anaconda the default Python.

macOS Video Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcSAln46u9U

1. Open https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos with your web browser.
2. Download the Python 3 installer for OS X.
3. Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation.

Linux

1. Open https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux with your web browser.
2. Download the Python 3 installer for Linux.
(The installation requires using the shell. If you aren't comfortable doing the installation yourself stop here and request help at the workshop.)
3. Open a terminal window.
4. Type: bash Anaconda3-and then press tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should appear. If it does not, navigate to the folder where you downloaded the file, for example with: cd Downloads. Then, try again.
5. Press enter. You will follow the text-only prompts. To move through the text, press the space key. Type yes and press enter to approve the license. Press enter to approve the default location for the files. Type yes and press enter to prepend Anaconda to your PATH (this makes the Anaconda distribution the default Python).
6. Close the terminal window.


**2. Obtain lesson materials**

1. Download python-novice-inflammation-data.zip (http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/data/python-novice-inflammation-data.zip) and python-novice-inflammation-code.zip (http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/code/python-novice-inflammation-code.zip). 
2. Create a folder called swc-python on your Desktop.
3. Move downloaded files into this newly created folder. 
4. Unzip the files. 

You should now see two new folders called data and code in your swc-python folder on your Desktop.

**3. Download the Python Notebook**
